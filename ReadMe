This program is a macro variable developed in SAS Base to conduct preliminary data exploration. The goal is to be able to explore different datasets. 

For the purpose of this project, we used the Rental Housing Dataset from Kaggle available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset

Minimal datacleaning was necessary for this project, however, we did separate the "Floors" category into 2 variables.

Originally, the data would keep this information as "Floor 3 of 10" (for example). We separated this to become Floor "3" and Total Floors "10". 

This was to reduce the number of categories in this variable, which originally had over 100 values, and to help with future modelling. 

The cleaned dataset has been included in this repository.

The first program, called "CreateTable", is used to generate a SAS table for this specific case. 

The second program, "TermProject", is our macro variable which conducts summary statistic and distribution analysis on our dataset.
